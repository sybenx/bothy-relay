// The write policy: who may publish to this relay, as one named level.
//
// docs/rungs.md describes a relay's write policy as a ladder, each step
// defined by WHO may write and WHAT BOUNDS THE VOLUME. This file is that
// ladder made concrete. The levels are CUMULATIVE -- each admits everyone
// the one below it admits and one more class of writer -- so the policy is
// a single value, and the ordering below is what "cumulative" means in
// code. The ordering is internal: nothing that reaches an owner (the
// management API, the env var, /api/stats, the admin page, the README)
// ever shows a number or the word "rung". They see the five names.
//
//   owner     Only events signed by the relay's owner.
//             Bounded by the owner's own posting rate.
//   inbox     + NIP-59 gift wraps from anyone, p-tagged to the owner
//             (relay.ts handleGiftWrap). Bounded by MAX_EVENT_BYTES, the
//             gift wrap storage share and the per-IP wrap throttle
//             (limits.ts).
//   follows   + any event signed by a pubkey in the owner's kind-3
//             contact list (ownership.ts refreshFollows). The default.
//             Bounded by the size of that list.
//   mentions  + any event, from any author, that p-tags the owner.
//             Bounded by how many people mention the owner -- and,
//             because "anyone" can choose that number, by
//             MAX_MENTION_EVENT_INDEXED_TAGS on top of the per-event
//             caps every non-owner write already pays.
//   all       + anything from anyone. Bounded only by the per-writer
//             caps (limits.ts MAX_EVENT_BYTES, MAX_EVENTS_PER_PUBKEY_PER_
//             WINDOW, NON_OWNER_STORAGE_BYTES). This is the open relay
//             docs/rungs.md calls the cliff; the owner steps off it
//             deliberately, and nip86.ts changewritepolicy asks for an
//             exact confirmation string before storing it.
//
// The explicit allowlist (NIP-86 allowpubkey) is not a level. An allowed
// pubkey writes under EVERY policy, and the policy says who ELSE does.
// banpubkey is the mirror image: a banned pubkey is refused under every
// policy, follows and mentions and all included.
//
// Where the value lives. `WRITE_POLICY` in the environment is for an
// operator who configures in the dashboard and wants the policy pinned
// there, where a stored value cannot quietly override it; the stored
// value (NIP-86 changewritepolicy, relay_settings) is for the owner
// changing it from a client without a redeploy; the default is
// `follows`, which is the policy this relay has shipped with since
// writes opened to the owner's contact list.
