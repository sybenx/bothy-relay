// How many tag rows one `#<letter>` condition is allowed to look at, per
// event the client asked for.
//
// A tag condition is resolved as `id IN (SELECT event_id FROM event_tags
// WHERE ...)`, and until v0.7.7 that subquery was bounded by nothing at
// all: it read every row carrying a named tag value, whatever the
// filter's `limit`. Measured at E=1,000 with every event p-tagging the
// owner, `{"#p":[owner],"limit":20}` read 4,000 rows -- and 4,000 again
// at `limit: 1`. Flat in the limit, linear in the table. That made
// limits.ts boundFilter structurally inert on the shape: halving a limit
// that the cost does not depend on can neither clamp the filter nor ever
// refuse it, so the one filter shape the read guard could not price was
// also the one NIP-17 clients send on every connect (relay.ts
// handleGiftWrap requires every gift wrap to p-tag the owner, which by
// construction makes `#p:<owner>` the highest-cardinality tag value in
// the table).
//
// Bounding the subquery is what makes the cost model in limits.ts true
// rather than aspirational: `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT n` against
// idx_event_tags_lookup (tag_name, tag_value, created_at) streams the
// index in the order the outer query already wants and stops, so the
// cost becomes 4 x n and falls with the limit like every other admitted
// shape. Measured, same fixture: 400 rows at `limit: 20`, 4 at
// `limit: 1`.
//
// The depth is DERIVED, not chosen: at MAX_FILTER_LIMIT a single-value
// tag filter should cost exactly the per-filter ceiling and no more, so
//
//   TAG_SCAN_DEPTH = MAX_FILTER_ROWS_READ / (TAG_ROWS_READ_PER_MATCH x MAX_FILTER_LIMIT)
//                  = 10,000 / (4 x 500) = 5
//
// It lives here rather than in limits.ts with the other caps only because
// limits.ts already imports this module; test/read-cost.test.ts asserts
// the identity above against those three constants so the number cannot
// go stale when one of them moves.
//
// What this trades away, stated plainly: completeness in one page. The
// subquery returns the newest TAG_SCAN_DEPTH x limit tag rows, and any
// other condition in the filter -- `kinds` most of all -- then narrows
// what survives, so a client can be handed fewer events than it asked
// for even though more exist. NIP-01 makes `limit` a maximum rather than
// a quota (nips/01.md), so a short page is legal; what makes it workable
// is the `since`/`until` pushdown below, which slides the window, so a
// client paginating with `until` still walks the whole history, just in
// smaller steps. The assumption underneath is density: a `#p:<owner>`
// filter for kind 1059 is short-paged in proportion to how few of the
// owner's p-tagged events are gift wraps, and on a personal relay whose
// non-owner write traffic is mostly gift wraps that ratio is high. If it
// ever is not, this constant is the dial -- and paying for it means
// paying rows read, which is the ceiling that took this relay down.

  // anything came back -- and a refusal that depends on what is stored
  // IS the answer to the question it refuses. An unauthenticated
  // `{"#p":[owner],"since":S,"until":U,"limit":1}` got `auth-required`
  // when a gift wrap fell inside the window and `EOSE` when none did, so
  // bisecting since/until yielded exact arrival times and an exact inbox
  // count, without the filter ever naming kind 1059. Omitting the rows
  // answers the same filter the same way whether or not the inbox holds
  // anything, which is the property the probe could not have.
  //
  // Applied only when the filter does not name `kinds` at all. A filter
  // that names 1059 explicitly is refused by the caller (relay.ts
  // handleReqInner) from `kinds` alone with no storage access -- refusing
  // there leaks nothing, since the client already stated what it wanted

  //
  //   {"#p":[owner],"limit":20}       priced 400   reads 301   no overshoot
  //   {"authors":[X],"limit":20}      priced  41   reads 2,002 bounded by
  //                                                            the inbox
  //
  // The tag shape cannot overshoot: its subquery carries its own LIMIT
  // (tagScanLimit above), so the candidate set is bounded before the

  // gift wraps the named author holds -- which is why limits.ts
  // maxGiftWraps is now bounded by MAX_FILTER_ROWS_READ and not by the
  // storage share alone. The price is a floor for that one shape; the
  // ceiling is the inbox cap, and it is inside the per-filter cap by
  // construction.
  //
  // NOT done in memory after the query, which would keep the price exact
  // and would reintroduce the leak in a worse form: a client asking for
  // 20 and receiving 8 has counted the gift wraps in its own window. The

  // that trade (relay.ts refuses an h-tagged gift wrap by isGroupEvent,
  // the same predicate the partition uses, rather than by a narrower
