//
// The original threat model had exactly one

// trusted not to attack their own relay. v0.2.0 made ALLOW_FOLLOWS an
// opt-OUT, which quietly turned "one trusted author" into "hundreds of

// gift wrap caps across. A single compromised or malicious follow was
// then bounded only by the per-IP message rate limit in relay.ts: at 300
// messages/minute and the measured 13 rows/event (CLAUDE.md "The budget"), about
// 26 minutes to exhaust the daily rows-written ceiling, and -- far worse,
// because storage does not reset daily -- under ten minutes to fill the
// free tier's whole 5GB permanently. Nothing in this codebase bounded an
// event's size; the only thing that did was SQLite's own 2MB maximum row
// size (developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/,
// checked 2026-08-25), which is a limit on what can be stored, not a

// happen; an expiry happens on its own.
//
// Refused rather than clamped, because clamping is a silent
// disagreement: the client that asked for a year would be told `["OK",

//
//   100,000 / 13 = 7,692 events to exhaust the daily write budget

//
// At 20 events/minute per pubkey:
//
//   7,692 / (20 * 60) = 6.4 hours

// is to make it slow enough that the owner notices and revokes (unfollow,

// any human posting rate: 20 notes a minute, sustained, is not a person.
//
// Counted in memory (relay.ts pubkeyRateLimits), like the two throttles

// the counter is lost when the Durable Object is evicted, so an attacker
// who pauses long enough for hibernation gets a fresh window. It is not
// airtight and is not claimed to be. What it does cover is the case it
// exists for -- sustained traffic keeps the object awake, so the window

// actually costs is a schnorr verify and a broadcast, and the existing
// per-IP message throttle (relay.ts RATE_LIMIT_MAX_MESSAGES: 50 per 10s)
// already shapes both -- so it is left to bound them alone. That throttle
// is per IP and covers every frame type on the connection, not ephemeral

// The read-abuse guard, derived from the index set.

// The rule this replaces was `isUnconstrainedFilter`: reject a filter
// carrying none of `ids`, `authors`, `kinds` or a `#<letter>` tag. It was
// a list of permitted field combinations, and it was wrong in the way
// every list of permitted shapes eventually is -- it reasoned about
// whether a field was PRESENT and never about what the resulting query
// COST. `{"kinds":[1],"limit":20}` satisfied it and read the entire
// table; so did `{"authors":[owner],"limit":20}`, on a relay where every
// row carries the owner's pubkey. 125 such REQs a day cleared the whole
// 5,000,000 rows-read ceiling, and an ordinary client that re-subscribes
// on reconnect issues far more than 125 (CLAUDE.md "The budget" "Rows read, by
// path").
//
// What replaces it asks a different question: WHICH INDEX SERVES THIS
// FILTER, AND WHAT DOES ITS `limit` COST AGAINST THAT INDEX. The answer
// is computed from schema.ts INDEXES, so it is the real index set that
// decides -- add an index and the filters it makes affordable become
// legal, drop one and they stop being legal, with nothing here to edit
// either way. That is the property the old rule lacked: its verdict and
// the schema could drift apart silently, and they did, for two releases.
//
// The cost model, and why each term is what it is:
//
//   rows read  =  combinations x (2 x limit + 1)
//
// `combinations` is the number of queries filters.ts expandFilter will
// actually run -- the cross-product of the filter's `authors` and
// `kinds` values. One query per combination, each pinning its index key
// columns to a single value, each stopping at `limit`.
//
// The 2 is measured, not assumed: an ordered index scan reads the index
// entry and then the table row it points at, and a filter naming one
// author and one kind at limit 20 reads 41 rows (test/read-cost.test.ts).
// 2 x 20 + 1 = 41.
//
// An index qualifies only when EVERY key column ahead of its ordering
// column is pinned to one value. `since`/`until` do not pin anything --
// they bound a range, and a range ahead of the sort column still leaves
// SQLite a sort to do -- which is why a filter of nothing but
// since/until/limit remains rejected, exactly as before.
//
// A `#<letter>` condition adds a second term rather than choosing
// between paths, since it is a conjunct and is evaluated whatever else
// the filter names:
//
//   rows read  =  combinations x (2 x limit + 1)  +  values x 4 x TAG_SCAN_DEPTH x limit
//
// Both terms scale with `limit`, which is the property the whole guard
// rests on and the one the tag term did not have until v0.7.7 -- see
// filters.ts TAG_SCAN_DEPTH.

// `largestNonOwnerAuthor` was deleted as a scan answering a question
// nothing asked, and `followCount` followed the same route -- maintained

// `LIMIT 1` is the column rather than a sample of it.

// relay.ts refreshStatsSnapshot and its cron call were a mechanism
// rationing a cost that no longer existed, and were removed together.
//
// The general lesson, since this file is where costs get priced: a TTL
// over an expensive read is a bound on how often you pay it, not on what
// it costs, and it survives only as long as nobody can make the read
// cheap. Reach for the counter first and the clock second.

// A second stats cap lived here after that one, LIVE_STATS_MAX_AGE_MS,
// bounding how stale the other half of /api/stats could get:
// `ingested24h` and `rowsWrittenToday`, the two windowed scans left when
// the counts that walked a table became counters. It is gone too, and it
// went the same way, one release later.
//
// It guarded ~1,200 rows per refresh -- both figures seek
// idx_events_ingested, so neither scaled with E, but both scaled with the
// ingest WINDOW, and GET /api/stats is unauthenticated with nothing in
// front of it. ~4,100 requests took the whole 5,000,000 rows-read/day
// allowance, from anywhere, at no cost to the caller. Five minutes was
// the arithmetic that bounded the recompute rate at 288/day however many
// requests arrived, chosen against
//
//   flood floor = (86,400 / T) x 1.5D   (D = events ingested per day)
//
// which at T = 60s admits only D <= 2,315 events/day and at T = 300s
// admits D <= 11,574 -- above anything the 100,000 rows-written ceiling
// lets this relay ingest.
//
// Both figures are hourly bucket counters now (schema.ts
// `ingest_hour_counts`), keyed by ingest time and read as at most 25 rows
// in one statement. That was named in this file as THE NEXT STEP if the
// TTL stopped being enough, with the caveat that these two were harder
// than `events24h`: `ingested24h` would want its own bucket table, and
// `rowsWrittenToday` is a sum over a window that empties at 00:00 UTC,
// which no per-event increment expresses. Both objections dissolved in
// the same table: one bucket row per ingest hour carries both figures, so
// the "third row written per event" is the same row as the second, and a
// UTC day boundary falls on a whole hour, so the reset is a range start
// rather than something a counter has to express.
//
// So the lesson above got its second demonstration in two releases, which
// is why it is stated as a rule rather than as a story: reach for the
// counter first and the clock second. There is no stats cache left, and
// nothing on /api/stats answers to a clock.

//     v0.7.2's two `events` indexes took the real figure to 15 without
//     anyone revisiting the arithmetic. The event_tags index in v0.7.3
//     takes it to 20, at which 128 would project 61,440 rows/day -- 123%
//     of the share, overrunning it again in exactly the same way.

// vanish at ANY share of 100,000 rows/day, so the property worth

// /api/stats reports every draining request and how far it has got --
