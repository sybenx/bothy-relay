//
// The original threat model (CLAUDE.md, chunk 6) had exactly one
// untrusted write path: kind-1059 gift wraps, "the only unbounded write
// path", since every other write was the owner's own and the owner is
// trusted not to attack their own relay. v0.2.0 made ALLOW_FOLLOWS an
// opt-OUT, which quietly turned "one trusted author" into "hundreds of
// pubkeys the owner has merely followed" -- without moving any of the
// gift wrap caps across. A single compromised or malicious follow was
// then bounded only by the per-IP message rate limit in relay.ts: at 300
// messages/minute and the measured 13 rows/event (docs/budget.md), about
// 26 minutes to exhaust the daily rows-written ceiling, and -- far worse,
// because storage does not reset daily -- under ten minutes to fill the
// free tier's whole 5GB permanently. Nothing in this codebase bounded an
// event's size; the only thing that did was SQLite's own 2MB maximum row
// size (developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/,
// checked 2026-08-25), which is a limit on what can be stored, not a
// defence. 5GB / 2MB is 2,560 events, and 2,560 events at 300/minute is
// eight and a half minutes. See docs/budget.md for the full before/after.
