  // the next cron tick, would therefore lose most of what it measured,
  // and lose more of it the quieter the relay is: the failure mode nobody
  // would notice, on the number an owner reads to decide whether the
  // relay is out of allowance or actually broken. So the rule is that a
  // total lands inside the execution context that produced it, before
  // that context returns, and this is where that rule is enforced.
  //
  // A wrapper rather than a call at the end of each method body, for the

  // to report itself: an early return, a thrown error or a new entry
  // point added later would each quietly skip a trailing call. `finally`

    // storage and rate caps deliberately exempt them." Refusing the

    // refuse -- to conserve a resource that is theirs to spend and whose
    // spend their own admin page already shows (rowsWrittenToday). And

    // that shape anyway: it bounds event FREQUENCY, while the damage was
    // cost PER EVENT -- a few touches a day, far under any plausible
    // rate, at ~1,000 rows each. Costs like that get fixed by making
    // them not scale, not by throttling the principal. Ephemeral

    // (limits.ts MAX_EVENTS_PER_PUBKEY_PER_WINDOW), and storeEvent writes
    // zero rows for an ephemeral event -- there is nothing here for the
    // cap to bound. What an ephemeral event actually costs is a schnorr
    // verify and a broadcast, and the per-IP message throttle
    // (RATE_LIMIT_MAX_MESSAGES) already shapes both of those. Left gated
