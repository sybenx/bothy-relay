// NIP-29 group events, and the four surfaces they have to be excluded
// from for an unauthenticated reader.
//
// An event belongs to a group when it carries an `h` tag (src/groups.ts) --
// KIND-AGNOSTIC, so a kind-1 note, a kind-7 reaction and a kind-30023
// long-form post are all group events if they name a group, and none of
// the tests below lean on a kind range.
//
// The four surfaces, each with its own describe block, because each one
// is reached by a different code path and an exclusion applied to one of
// them is not applied to the others:
//
//   1. REQ results          handleReqInner -> queryFilters
//   2. broadcast()          the push to subscriptions registered BEFORE
//                           the event arrived, which the REQ-time gate
//                           never re-examines
//   3. liveBroadcast()      the admin page's unauthenticated /live feed
//   4. /api/stats           maintained counters, which a poller can watch
//                           advance
//
// Plus the cost invariant the whole design rests on: excluding the group
// is a partition seek, not a post-filter, so an unauthenticated read costs
// what it costs on an empty relay however much group traffic there is.
